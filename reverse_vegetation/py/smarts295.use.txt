Compile python library pysmarts from smarts295MOD.f:
	python -m numpy.f2py -c smarts295MOD.f -m pysmarts

Create 2 arrays:
	l = np.zeros(shape=(14,636))	# holds full wavelengths, and 13 spectra
	c = np.zeros(shape=(6,851))		# holds convolved wavelengths, and 5 spectra

Call subroutine:
	l, c = smarts295(myTAIR,myRH,myTDAY,myW,myAbO3,
                     myApCH2O,myApCH4,myApCO,myApHNO2,myApHNO3,
